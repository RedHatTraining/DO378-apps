You should be able to apply different fault tolerance policies to Quarkus applications given identified potential faults.

== Present App Flow

The present lab makes use of Session, Speaker and Schedule services.

* `Aliveness` and `Readiness` checks are implemented.
* Prepare the Session service to use `fault tolerance` features.
* Create a `fallback` and enable the fault tolerance policy.
* Create a fallback method for returning `non-enriched` speaker information.
* Adding a `fake delay` to the endpoint method used by other external client.
* Implementing `retry policy` on methods during unavailability.
* Protect the methods from `concurrent requests`.
